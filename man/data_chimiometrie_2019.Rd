\description{
Larsen and Clemmensen (2019) state: "This data set was published as the
challenge at the Chimiometrie 2019 conference held in Montpellier and is
available at the conference homepage. The data consist of 6915 training
spectra and 600 test spectra measured at 550 (unknown) wavelengths. The
target was the amount of soy oil (0-5.5\%), ucerne (0-40\%) and barley
(0-52\%) in a mixture."

The test set included a distribution shift due to the use of a different
instrument and this competition was designed to measure how models might be
made to be resistant to such a difference. However, since there are no
test set outcomes, we only include the training set here.

There are 6,915 rows and 553 columns. The columns whose names start with
\code{wvlgth_} are the spectral values with the numbers in the column names
referring to the order (as opposed to the wavenumber). Fernández
Pierna (2020) suggest that the wavelengths range from 1300 2nm to 2398 2nm.

The three outcome columns are \code{"soy_oil"}, \code{"lucerne"}, and \code{"barley"}.
